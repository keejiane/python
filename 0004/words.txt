Vast tent cities have sprung up for those displaced by the earthquake in Nepal, which is now reported to have killed some 2,500 people.
Many residents of the capital, Kathmandu, who lost their homes as a result of the tremor spent a second night outside on Sunday.
They are afraid to return to their homes - especially after strong aftershocks hit the region on Sunday.
The quake triggered avalanches on Mount Everest, killing at least 17 people.
More than 60 people were injured on the mountain.
Efforts to dig victims out from under the rubble of collapsed buildings in Kathmandu continued throughout Sunday night.
Rescue missions and aid have started arriving to help cope with the aftermath of the worst earthquake to hit Nepal for more than 80 years.
The situation is still unclear in remote areas which remain cut off or hard to access, but initial reports suggest that many communities - especially those close to mountainsides - suffered significant quake damage.
Landslides have prevented rescue teams from reaching rural communities in the area where the quake was centred, chief Gorkha region district official Prakash Subedi said.
"Villages like this are routinely affected by landslides, and it's not uncommon for entire villages of 200, 300, up to 1,000 people to be completely buried by rock falls," World Vision spokesman Matt Darvas said. "It will likely be helicopter access only."
The 7.8-magnitude quake struck an area of central Nepal between Kathmandu and the city of Pokhara early on Saturday.
